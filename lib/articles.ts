    content: `If we pause for a moment and look at how humanity relates to the natural world today, we notice a strange paradox. We speak endlessly of "sustainability," of "saving the planet," of "green growth." Yet, the same societies that chant these words continue to prize economic growth above all else. Governments measure progress in GDP, companies compete to sell more, and individuals are urged to consume endlessly — all in the name of prosperity. Something about this equation doesn't quite add up. Can an economic system that depends on perpetual growth ever truly be sustainable?

To answer that question, we need to look at the foundations of modern economic thought — where it came from, what assumptions it carries, and how deeply those assumptions shape our collective behavior.

**The Anthropocentric View of the World**

Modern economics is built upon an anthropocentric worldview — one that places humans, particularly human desires, at the center of the universe. Nature, in this view, is not a living system but a backdrop, a warehouse of resources waiting to be used. The environment becomes an "externality," something to be managed or priced, not something with intrinsic value or spirit.

This way of thinking did not emerge by accident. It was shaped in the late eighteenth century by thinkers such as Adam Smith, whose influential work The Wealth of Nations (1776) laid the groundwork for modern capitalism. Smith's central idea — that individuals pursuing their own self-interest will, through competition and the "invisible hand" of the market, create prosperity for all — became the cornerstone of economic theory.

This might have made sense in an age of limited industry and abundant natural resources, when human activity seemed insignificant compared to the vastness of the planet. But as centuries passed, this logic of self-interest and endless competition began to dominate every sphere of life. Nature was redefined as "natural capital," forests became "timber reserves," rivers became "water assets," and even people were reduced to "human resources."

The result is a world economy that treats the Earth not as a community to which we belong, but as a set of assets to be exploited for profit.

**Growth as the Holy Grail**

At the heart of modern economics lies an obsession with growth. Every nation seeks to raise its GDP year after year, and every corporation aims to expand its market share. The health of an economy is measured not by the well-being of its people or the balance of its ecosystems, but by the rate at which it produces and consumes goods.

The logic seems innocent enough: more growth means more jobs, more income, and more happiness. But when growth becomes an end in itself, it leads to absurdities. We live in a culture where "buy one, get one free" is celebrated as smart shopping, and where disposable goods are cheaper than durable ones. The planet's finite resources are consumed as if they were infinite — trees cut faster than they grow, fish caught faster than they can reproduce, and fossil fuels burned faster than nature can replenish them.

Economists call this progress. Ecologists call it overshoot.

This obsession with growth reveals the core inconsistency of modern economic theory with sustainability. Sustainability requires limits, but modern economics abhors them. It thrives on expansion — of production, consumption, markets, and desires. The very measure of success, GDP, rewards depletion of natural wealth and pollution as long as they create monetary transactions. A factory that pollutes a river adds to GDP; the community that cleans up the mess adds even more.

How can a system that counts destruction as growth ever be sustainable?

**The Separation of Man and Nature**

At the philosophical level, the inconsistency goes even deeper. Modern economics rests on the assumption that humans are separate from nature — masters, not members, of the living world. This dualistic thinking is not unique to economics; it runs through much of Western modernity, from René Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" to Francis Bacon's idea that science should "conquer nature."

By contrast, many ancient and Indigenous worldviews saw no such separation. In these traditions, the human and the natural were not two opposing entities but part of a single, living web.

The Isha Upanishad, one of the oldest philosophical texts of India, expresses this unity in a verse of profound simplicity:

*"That is whole; this is whole. From the whole, the whole arises. When the whole is removed from the whole, the whole remains."*

This mantra reveals a vision of reality where nothing is truly separate — every part of the universe contains the whole, and the whole is never diminished. Such thinking leaves no room for the exploitation of one part (nature) by another (man), because both are expressions of the same reality.

Similarly, in Australian Indigenous culture, the concept of "Country" refers to much more than land. Country is not property; it is a living presence that includes people, ancestors, plants, animals, water, and spirit — all bound in mutual relationship. To care for Country is not environmental activism; it is a moral and spiritual duty, an act of maintaining balance in the fabric of life itself.

In Chinese Taoist philosophy, we find a similar sensibility. The Tao, or "Way," is the natural order of the universe, spontaneous and self-sustaining. To live wisely is to follow the Tao, to act in harmony with nature rather than trying to dominate it. Lao Tzu wrote, "Man follows the earth. Earth follows heaven. Heaven follows the Tao. The Tao follows what is natural." It is a gentle but profound reminder that humanity is not above the natural order but within it.

**Sustainability as a Way of Life**

True sustainability cannot be grafted onto an economic system that celebrates endless consumption. It requires a cultural shift — from having more to being more. It is not about managing resources more cleverly; it is about rethinking our relationship with the world.

In many ways, the modern crisis is not ecological but spiritual. We have lost the sense of belonging to something greater than ourselves. The forests are burning not just because of industrial greed, but because of a deeper alienation — a worldview that sees the Earth as "other."

The ancient wisdom traditions — whether Indian, Indigenous, Taoist, or even certain mystical strands of Christianity and Sufism — all remind us that well-being arises from harmony, not domination. St. Francis of Assisi, centuries before the modern environmental movement, spoke of "Brother Sun and Sister Moon," recognizing kinship with all creation. The Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi wrote, "The universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you already are." These words, like those of the Upanishads, dissolve the boundaries between self and world.

When we begin to see ourselves not as consumers but as participants in the great web of life, sustainability stops being a slogan and becomes a way of being. A culture rooted in such awareness would measure prosperity not by GDP, but by balance — between needs and resources, between human ambition and the capacity of the Earth.

**The Way Forward**

The irony is that economics itself, at its most honest, cannot escape the truth of limits. The Earth is finite. Infinite growth on a finite planet is a mathematical impossibility. To acknowledge this is not to reject progress but to redefine it.

What if we saw progress as the art of living well within limits? What if efficiency meant not producing more with less, but needing less in the first place? What if success was measured by the health of our communities, the purity of our rivers, and the resilience of our soils?

Some societies and thinkers are already moving in this direction. The "degrowth" movement in Europe, for instance, questions the obsession with GDP and advocates for economies centered on well-being, equity, and ecological balance. The Bhutanese concept of Gross National Happiness, though imperfect, offers another attempt to reorient policy around human and ecological flourishing rather than profit.

But perhaps the greatest transformation will not come from governments or institutions. It will come from a shift in consciousness — from a rediscovery of what the Isha Upanishad called "the wholeness of all things." When we act from that awareness, sustainability is not an effort; it is the natural outcome of harmony.

**Conclusion**

Modern economic theory, in its present form, cannot deliver sustainability because it is built upon a philosophy of separation — man versus nature, individual versus community, profit versus planet. Sustainability, in contrast, arises from a philosophy of unity. It invites us to remember that the world is not made of competing parts but of interwoven wholes.

As the Yajurveda prays:
*"Peace be in the sky. Peace be in the atmosphere. Peace be in the earth… Peace in all things. Peace alone."*

These ancient words, spoken millennia ago, are not relics of the past. They are a message to our time — a reminder that peace with the Earth begins with peace within ourselves. Only when we rediscover that inner wholeness can humanity hope to build a truly sustainable future.

Because the Earth does not need saving — we do.

    content: `*A short story by Jeevak*

"I've spent my entire life babysitting a grown man with talent for poetry and the emotional depth of a teaspoon." Devika sighed, her voiced laced with bitter wit. "Sure, he can string words into magic on the paper, but when it comes to being a good brother, husband or father—he's always on a short-circuit. How can someone be so stone-hearted to ignore and reject his new born son for months? She paused, her wrinkles getting more pronounced and eyes glistening. "Perhaps I enabled him, fed his ego. Look at him—still expecting applauses and batting away responsibilities." I held her soft, warm, time-worn hands and could feel her deep resentment through her watery eyes and parched lips. It's a strange ache, to watch your mother carry decades of disappointment, wearing it each day. Especially now, in the twilight of her long luminous struggle.

"Daadi, did you finish your tea?" This was the cheerful voice of Anjali, coming from the doorway.

She was one of those age care workers, who had not traded her soul for the clock-in card. She radiated a genuine warmth that put a question mark on 'tired disillusionment' that many carry in this profession. My mother looked at her and gave a reassuring smile — a brief reprieve from the haunted story of her older son Ravi that had begun few moments ago.

"Yes, Beta. I did. Thank you," my mother replied.

Anjali smiled back, collected the mug and left the room quietly. My mother gazed at me.

"Do you think God forgives a mother if she doesn't feel pain when her first born leaves this world?"

The question hit hard. I shifted in my seat.

"Amma, I don't think it works that way. You mourned him in your own way. For years. You just… stopped." I paused. "And maybe that's okay."

She looked out the window—the winter light filtered through sheer white curtains, casting soft shadows across her lined face. Outside, a magpie warbled.

"You know, that bird reminds me of Ravi," she said, nodding toward the window. "Always loud. Always demanding attention. Never quite landing anywhere for long."

I wanted to argue. Defend him. But I couldn't. Ravi had been that way — a kind of beautiful disaster. Talented, yes. Tortured, certainly. But also cruel in the small, grinding ways that siblings remember long after the world forgets.

**The Brother**

I was seven when Ravi first left home. He was sixteen. No goodbye, just a note on the kitchen table: *I'm not staying in this small-town prison*. My mother cried for weeks. My father didn't say much — he never did. But I remember the way he stopped humming in the mornings.

Ravi came back a few times over the years. Always broke. Always with a new story. Once, he showed up at 3 AM, drunk and weeping. Another time, he brought a woman — older, exhausted, visibly uncomfortable. They stayed two days. She never spoke to any of us.

He published his first book of poetry when I was twenty. The reviews were glowing. He sent us a signed copy. The inscription read: *To the family I was given, not the one I would have chosen*.

My mother framed it anyway.

"He was a sick man," she said now, her voice softer. "I know that. Depression, mania — whatever the doctors called it. But… it doesn't erase the hurt, does it?"

"No," I said. "It doesn't."

She looked at me with a tired smile. "You're a good son. Too good, maybe. You stayed. You married. You gave me Aditi." She gestured toward the door, where my teenage daughter was likely scrolling her phone in the hallway.

"I didn't do it to be good," I said quietly. "I just… didn't know how to leave."

She squeezed my hand. "Maybe that's the same thing."

**The Poet**

Ravi's funeral was small. Thirty people, maybe. Some old friends, a few literary types who eulogized him like he was Sylvia Plath. One woman cried so hard she had to leave mid-service. I'd never seen her before.

My mother sat stone-faced through it all.

Afterward, at the reception, someone asked her if she'd like to say a few words. She declined. Later, when we were alone, she said: "What would I say? That he was brilliant? Everyone knows that. That he was troubled? That's obvious. That I loved him? I did. But I'm tired of pretending it was enough."

It wasn't a question. It was a fact.

**Now**

She's been in aged care for six months now. The dementia comes and goes. Some days, she's sharp as ever. Other days, she thinks I'm my father. Once, she called me Ravi. That one stung.

Today is one of the clear days. And she's talking about him again. Not with anger this time. Just… exhaustion.

"You know what I regret most?" she said.

"What?"

"That I spent so much time hoping he'd change. Hoping he'd wake up one day and realize what he'd thrown away." She paused. "I should have just let him be. Loved him from a distance. Saved myself the heartbreak."

"That's hard to do," I said.

"Everything's hard," she said, her voice cracking slightly. "But I wasted so much energy on him. And now…" She gestured vaguely at the room, at herself. "Now I'm here. And he's gone. And it all feels so… pointless."

I wanted to tell her it wasn't pointless. That motherhood matters. That memory matters. But the words felt hollow.

So instead, I just sat with her.

**Departure**

That night, after I left the care facility, I drove to the beach. It was cold, windy. The kind of evening Ravi would have loved — dramatic, moody, suffused with melancholy.

I thought about the last time I saw him alive. It was three years ago. He was living in a share house in the inner city, writing sporadically, drinking heavily. I'd stopped by to drop off some money my mother had insisted I give him.

"She still thinks she can save you," I'd said, handing him the envelope.

He'd laughed—a bitter, hollow sound. "Tell her I'm beyond saving."

"I think she knows," I'd replied.

He'd looked at me then, really looked at me. And for a moment, I saw something I hadn't seen in years: vulnerability. Fear. Regret.

"I'm sorry," he'd said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being the brother you deserved better than."

I'd wanted to argue. To tell him it wasn't too late. That we could fix things. But I didn't believe it. And I think he knew.

So I just nodded. "Take care of yourself, Ravi."

He'd smiled—a sad, resigned smile. "I'll try."

**Now**

I stood on the beach, watching the waves crash against the shore. The wind stung my face. Somewhere in the distance, a seagull cried.

I thought about my mother's question: *Do you think God forgives a mother if she doesn't feel pain when her first born leaves this world?*

And I thought: Maybe God doesn't need to forgive her. Maybe she's already forgiven herself. Not because she stopped loving Ravi. But because she realized that love — especially the kind mothers give — doesn't always save people.

Sometimes, it just holds the space for them to fall.

And maybe that's enough.

I turned and walked back to my car. The sun had set completely now. The sky was dark, heavy with clouds. It looked like rain.

As I drove home, I thought about Aditi. About how she's nothing like Ravi — steady, kind, grounded. And I thought about how terrified I am that one day, she'll leave too. Not physically. But emotionally. The way children do when they grow up and realize their parents are just people.

And I wondered: Will I handle it better than my mother did?

Or will I, too, spend decades hoping for something that was never mine to hold?

**Epilogue**

My mother passed away six months later. Peacefully, they said. In her sleep.

At her funeral, I found a letter in her belongings. It was addressed to Ravi. Never sent.

*Dear Ravi,*

*I forgive you. Not because you asked. But because I'm tired of carrying this weight.*

*I hope, wherever you are, you've found peace.*

*Love, Amma*

I folded the letter carefully and placed it in my pocket.

That night, I drove back to the beach. The same one. The wind was just as cold, the waves just as loud.

I stood there for a long time, holding the letter.

And then, finally, I let it go.

The wind carried it out over the water, tumbling and twisting, until it disappeared into the dark.

I watched until I couldn't see it anymore.

And then I turned and walked away.

Because sometimes, the only way forward is to let the past drift out to sea.

**THE END**`,

    content: `Let me ask you something—something vast, almost impossible to hold in the palm of your mind.

How many human beings do you think have ever walked this Earth?

Go on—take a wild guess.

The best estimate we have is this: around **one hundred billion** Homo sapiens—people like you, people like me—have wandered across this spinning blue planet. Each one utterly unique, a single note in an eternal symphony. And yet, out of that hundred billion, only about eight billion still walk among us. The rest have stepped beyond the horizon.

And unless you've stumbled upon the secret to eternal youth in your garage, that horizon awaits you and me as well. With a few exceptions, anyone born more than a century ago has already moved on. Even the most spirited Victorian jogger has long since hung up their running shoes.

Here lies the truth—Death is the one universal truth that we all share. We hide it under blankets, in the shadows of busy days, behind the clutter of our calendars—because to gaze at it directly can be like staring into the sun: dazzling, searing, and a little terrifying. Yet it remains—the most predictable moment of life is its end. We do not know how, we do not know when, but we know it is coming.

Stick with me, I promise this isn't all gloom and doom. Although, it's going to get a little bumpier before it gets better.

And here's the other truth— if we do not die young, we grow old.

Now, don't be fooled by the sprightly 90-year-old salsa dancer or the octogenarian on a motorcycle—they're exceptions, not the rule. Life expectancy isn't a personal guarantee, it's a population average. But thanks to our confirmation bias, we hold onto those uplifting images and convince ourselves, old age is a charming, slow waltz into the sunset. In reality, for most (even the wealthy), it's more of a shuffle—with creaks, leaks, and the occasional existential crisis. And yet, we _want_ more of it. Why? Let's ponder.

The poets call it autumn; science calls it **senescence**—the gradual wearing down of the exquisite systems that keep us alive. Our muscles tire. Our memory blurs. Our cells, once full of youthful fire, begin to yield to the quiet work of time. But here's the marvel—aging is no longer just a poetic metaphor; it is a mystery science is learning to read. **Gerontology**, the study of aging, peers into this Biological and psychosocial process, searching for the threads that weave our journey from vitality to fragility.

At its heart lies a force as old as the universe, the science calls it **entropy**—the universe's cyclical drift from order into disorder. As embryos, our cells divide like eager little overachievers, building up potential energy to create a whole, functional human. But once the masterpiece is complete, entropy begins its patient dismantling. The ice- cream in the freezer holds its shape—until the power fades. Then the edges blur, the structure loosens, and what was once solid, begins to soften into formlessness. Slowly, surely, energy dissipates. Randomness increases. And the slow unravelling begins.

Each multicellular organism, using energy from the sun, is able to develop and maintain its identity for only so long. Then deterioration prevails over synthesis, the organism ages, and then eventually dies. In the end, entropy always wins—but that doesn't mean we can't play a beautiful, meaningful game before the final whistle.

If we can slow down entropy—if we can hold onto that youthful potential energy just a little longer—we can age more gracefully. The key is not in chasing eternal youth through products, scalpels, and potions—they offer only the illusion of permanence. No, the key lies in two living arts: **physical agility** and **mental agility**.

Mental agility—described by neuroscientists and cherished by Zen masters—is the ability to keep the mind supple, to shift between perspectives with the grace of a dancer changing steps. It is the **beginner's mind**—the childlike curiosity that sees possibility everywhere. But our modern world, with its algorithms, routines, and relentless specialization, has starved this curiosity. As our expertise deepens, our openness narrows. In a beginner's mind there are infinite possibilities; in an expert's mind, only a few. And with each narrowing, entropy sets in, accelerating the aging.

Stress is another silent thief—keeping the body in the clenched fist of fight-or-flight, flooding it with cortisol, fraying the edges of our vitality. But stress dissolves in the presence of **meaningful connection**—the kind that makes you feel seen, heard, and understood. Loneliness, on the other hand, amplifies the erosion.

That is why we must build, what I call, an **Inner Circle**—of those with whom we share trust, curiosity, and our undivided attention. The Eastern philosophy of impermanence teaches that nothing is fixed—not our bodies, not our emotions, not even our relationships. Joy is not a constant state; it is a tide. To cling is to suffer. To connect, knowing all is changing, is to taste the sweetness of the moment. Understanding the Aboriginal philosophy of **KanYini,** further deepens this thought. In KanYini—we're each unique, yet bound together in a web of connection with each other, the land and our ever-changing world.

So here is the invitation.

Do not spend your days chasing the shadow of youth. Instead, let your body remain agile. Your mind a beginner, and your heart open to deep connection. Practice KanYini. Cultivate curiosity. Move with grace, in both body and thought. And you will find that even as entropy quietly works its way through you, your days will be filled with vitality, meaning, and a kind of bliss that is untouched by age.
